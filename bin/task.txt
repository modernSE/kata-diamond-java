= Task

== Normal Case

You need to return a string that when printed, displays a diamond shape on the screen using asterisk ("*") characters. 
Please see provided test cases for exact output format.

The shape that will be returned from print method resembles a diamond, where the number provided as input represents the number of *’s printed on the middle line.
The line above and below will be centered and will have 2 less *’s than the middle line. This reduction by 2 *’s for each line continues until a line with a single * is printed at the top and bottom of the figure.

== Special Cases

Return null if input is even number or negative (as it is not possible to print diamond with even number or negative number).
