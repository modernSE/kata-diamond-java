# Diamond Kata

We want to make our loved one happy and what better way than giving a sparkling little diamond?
But of course in the most geeky way possible: ASCII art!

We even already have found an open source project wich does exactly that! For examle it prints:
```
  *
 ***
*****
 ***
  *
```

## Task
Hmm... but it is a little difficult to understand. How does the **algorithm** even work? What do the paramameters and variables mean?
Can you help out and make the code better? Focus on naming! Structural refactorings only if you are happy with the naming.
